# Figma: From Design to CSS Implementation
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course `Figma: From Design to CSS Implementation`. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url]. 

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. This serves as the starter project for each movie in the course.
The `main` branch holds the final state of the code.
